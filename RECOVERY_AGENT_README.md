# 🕵️♂️ AI Recovery Agent - Demo Guide

## 🌟 **The Concept**
"Merchants hate asking for money. It ruins relationships. 
But cash flow is king. 
We built an **AI Agent** that handles collections politely, persistently, and autonomously."

---

## 🚀 **Feature Highlights**

### **1. 🧠 Data Intelligence (Risk Scores)**
- **What to show**: The "Risk" badges on the dashboard.
- **Narrative**: "We don't just list names. We analyze payment history to flag High/Medium/Low risk customers."

### **2. 🎛️ Mission Control (The Sci-Fi HUD)**
- **What to show**: The dark mode calling interface.
- **Narrative**: "This isn't a phone dialer. It's a real-time negotiation terminal."
- **Visuals**: Pulse rings, sound waves, scrolling transcript.

### **3. 🗣️ Localization (The India Factor)**
- **What to show**: The "AGENT: SARAH (HINDI+ENGLISH)" badge.
- **Narrative**: "Raju might not speak English. Our AI switches languages dynamically based on the customer's response."

### **4. ❤️ Sentiment Analysis**
- **What to show**: The status indicator (Neutral -> Positive/Negative).
- **Narrative**: "If the customer gets angry, the AI detects it instantly and de-escalates. You can see the mood shift in real-time."

## 🛠️ **Technical Details for Jury**

- **Voice AI**: Vapi.ai (LLM + TTS + STT pipeline).

## ⚠️ **Demo Tips**

- **Audio ON**: The visualizer implies sound, but good to have volume up if you add TTS later.
- **Simulation Mode**: Currently running in "Wizard of Oz" mode (100% reliable for demo).
- **Full Screen**: The dark mode modal looks best in full screen.
